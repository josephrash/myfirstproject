<h2>how to spend the day doing nothing</h2><br/>
<p>
     
        first off, you have to wake. I guess the only thing you'd be doing is breathing cause it's kinda
        innevitable, asides that this would teach you to not do anything and still have a good ass day. You're
        prolly thinking wtf is this guy and how tf does he feel he has anything reasonable to say, well you
        correct but give me the benefit of doubt first, take it that i'm a pro in doing nothing and it has
        worked for me and now i'm willing to share the rare ability.
